        <p>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For iOS Users (App Tracking Transparency):</strong></p>
        <p>Regarding the use of your Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for tracking purposes, we rely on your <strong>explicit consent</strong>.

You can grant or deny this permission, and you can change your mind at any time in your iOS Settings.</p>

        <h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p><strong>Opting out of Marketing and Advertising:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time. To opt-out of interest-based advertising on your mobile device, you can check the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and select "Limit Ad Tracking" (Apple iOS) or "Opt-out of Interest-based ads" (Android), or manage your preferences via the App Tracking Transparency prompt on iOS 14+.</p>

        <h2>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature.
